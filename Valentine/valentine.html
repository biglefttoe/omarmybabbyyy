        <h3>
            Hello baby, I made this little thing as a valentine's day gift for you baby. While coding this website, my
            smile
            didnt leave my face and I just looked forward to sending it to you. I felt so happy imagining how happy it
            would
            make you, and most importantly I felt happy expressing my love for you. Never in my life have I ever thought
            I'd
            have a valentine. And you're not just my valentine, you're my husband. The love of my life. The father of my
            kids and the one I'm spending the rest of my life with. Starting 2024, I didn't think I'd meet the person
            for
            me. It seemed like it'd be a very far thing if it even happened to begin with. So being able to experience
            this
            wallah it's such a blessing. It's such a blessing to have you, to be able to call you mine, all mine. It's
            such
            a privilege to love you. And wallah I'm so glad it's you and I. I can't imagine my life another way. I
            believe
            you're my soulmate, the person whose name was written next to mine 50k years before my existence, the person
            whose missing rib I come from. I miss you so much omari, day and night my head is filled with thoughts of
            you,
            thoughts of us experiencing and living life together. I'm so excited to be with you, althought he process
            hurts.
            I miss being able to hear your voice, to hear you yap ab your day, to wake up to your messages, to call you,
            to
            sending you kissign videos, to take pictures of myself throughout the day and seeing your reaction to that.
            My
            heart deeply craves it. It hurts to be away from you. All I want is to hear your voice, your laugh, your
            mwahs,
            your o i i a is I EVEN MISS THOSE AND GIGGLIGN WHILE IM SLEEPING WHILE U SAY DUM DUM STUFF IN MY EARS
            oopsies i
            lost the professionalism im trying to type correctly and all but flip it HEHEHE :333. I just really miss you
            overall my love. Your presence is all I need. When something bad happens all I want is to run to u and feel
            uer
            comfort. Feel ur presence with me and be assured that everything wll be okay. I got disqualified from the
            math
            olympiads and I found myself immediately going to ig to text u and express my sadness to u but u werent
            there. i wss just holdingmy phone at school but there wasnt anyone to text. No one feels like u do, no one
            can
            ever replace that spot that u hold baby. ur my home. my everything. I know it will gt better inshaa Allah. I
            know allah will unite us together Inshaa Allah when the time is good and when we can do it the halal and
            right
            way. Until then, as long as Im with you and itll end with you in my arms i dont care how long ti would take.
            If
            it means being with u then im ready to wait as long as I can exist for. Because then my biggest goal in life
            wouldve came true. Id have the one thing I need the most and that is to be with u. I dedicate myself to u
            baby.
            As long as im here ull always have the biggest supporter by ur side, ul always be loved and cherished and
            cared
            for. Because ur my whole life, ur my blood vessel baby. Without u ill break. Ur whats holding me together
            like a
            puzzle piece u complete me. Theres no basma without omar and thats certain. All my heart knows is omar, all
            my
            brain knows is omar, all my eyes see is a future with omar. the thought of being able to hold u, and feel ur
            warmth wallah that alone makes me want to push through this harder. Just looking at u with my very own eyes
            and
            being able to feel ur features and to hear u directly and just feel ur existence that alone is enough for
            me.
            Thinking back about old stuff baby just makes me realize how stupid i really was before and it hurts me to
            know
            that i hurt u previously baby, and im really sorry for that. idk why it was hard for me to remove those
            stupid
            useless male specimen i had inmy life but thank u for being patient wiht me baby altho that hurt u. i
            feelstupid
            for giving u such a hard time witht hat, especially bc now im the happiest i couldve ever been.maybe it was
            ego
            that held me back back then or i had a fear of missing out on smth but im so grateful for u helping me see
            things clearly baby. it was never a normal thing and im sorry that i took long to realize that and hurt u in
            the
            process. if i had to do it again i wouldnt have hesitated this time. thank u for beingpatient with me baby,
            for
            not giving u p on me. but yk theres something that hasnt rlly left my brain since then and whnever i think
            ab it
            it just makesme acknlowdge more and more ur love for me. and how i could never ever regret being with u. yk
            when
            we argued this one time atnight during the summer and i had a n asthma attack yet u dropped all of the
            argument
            and js forgot ab it even tho u were the one who was hurt and still cared forme and bc of ur worry over my
            health
            it didnt matter to u anymore. im sure u forgot about this already but whenever i think ab it im just like
            alhamdulilah. no one can love me the way u truly do, no one could ever come an inch to being as caring as u
            are
            and alhamdulilah i got sososososo lucky to be able to have all this lvoe for myself. i love u so much baby,
            i
            truly love u. inshaa Allah well get married and this will all eb nothing but a memory we tell and think of
            at
            times. I have a deep belief that this is it honey. ur th eone for me and im the one for u and inshaa Allah
            this
            is the only way itll ever be. thank ufor everything my love, thank uf or existing and loving me. andshowing
            me
            that love actulaly exists and from saving me from the bad life i lived before meeting u. because of u my
            imaan
            strengthened, and my life just overall got better. Ive never been this happy and fulfilled in my love, but
            again
            ur my happiness and now that ur here i feel all of the happiness i could ever feel.
